### Subjectivity in Color

  - Concepts like warm, cool, gritty, romantic, or cinematic vary by person.

- Goal of color grading:
  - Express your personal viewpoint through the image.
  - Develop confidence in your own visual taste.

### Developing Taste & Skill

#### Key Principles

- Taste development:
  - A major part of becoming a good colorist is learning what looks good.
  - Early grades will not be perfect—and that’s expected.

- Progress through repetition:
  - Each project improves your eye and decision-making.
  - Frustration is part of the learning curve.

#### Practical Advice

- Walk away from shots:
  - Taking breaks helps you return with fresh eyes.

- Study references:
  - Analyze films and images you love.
  - Observe lighting, contrast, color balance, and mood.

- Apply inspiration:
  - Recreate and adapt those looks in your own work.

### Long-Term Growth

  - Recognize how an image was shot.

- Focus on small details:
  - Minor refinements often create the biggest impact.
  - These details lead to images that feel polished and professional.

### Professional Validation

- Client feedback:
  - Success often sounds like:
    - “I don’t know what you did, but it looks amazing.”

- This response signals:
  - Strong taste.
  - Effective, invisible grading decisions.

### Final Encouragement

- Practice consistently:
  - Improvement comes from repetition.

- Keep moving forward:
  - Skills compound over time.

- Outcome:
  - With persistence, you grow into a confident colorist, editor, or filmmaker.
