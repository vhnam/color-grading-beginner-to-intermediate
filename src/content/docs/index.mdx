      This module introduces the fundamentals of color grading. You'll learn how
      to control the essential building blocks of an image using lift, gamma,
      and gain, as well as refine details like highlights, shadows, and
      saturation. By the end, you'll be able to recognize and apply basic
      corrections that bring balance and clarity to your footage.
