## Learning Objectives

- Execute a repeatable workflow to match multiple shots for consistent color and contrast.
- Evaluate continuity across a sequence and refine problem shots.
- Produce a cohesive look that holds up across edits and export.

## ToC

- Bringing it All Together
- Final Thoughts

## Step-by-Step Shot Matching Using Focused Color Correction

### Reset and Preparation

- Reset all grades:

  - Clear nodes and adjustments.
  - Start from a neutral baseline.

- Goal:

  - Apply a clean, repeatable matching workflow using analysis and Resolve tools.

### Establishing a Reference Shot

- Choose the key shot:

  - Shot in log.
  - Best exposure and dynamic range.

- Initial adjustments:

  - Match shadows and highlights using waveform.
  - Slight contrast increase.
  - Add saturation and color boost to bring log footage into a usable state.

- Purpose:

  - Use this shot as the visual reference for all others.

### Primary Matching Pass

- Luminance matching:

  - Align shadows and highlights across shots with waveforms.
  - Fix clipped highlights early.

- White balance:

  - Warm overly blue shots using temperature.
  - Correct tint shifts before fine color work.

- Strategy:

  - Rough matching first, perfection later.

### Secondary Corrections (Granular Adjustments)

- Sky adjustments:

  - Use HSL qualifier to key the sky.
  - Combine with windows to isolate only the upper frame.
  - Adjust temperature, tint, brightness, and color to match skies.

- Vegetation and trees:

  - Key greens and pink foliage separately.
  - Adjust:

    - Hue vs Hue to shift color.
    - Hue vs Saturation to refine intensity.
    - Luminance to balance brightness.

- Objects and surfaces:

  - Use windows for static elements (e.g., pedestal).
  - Reduce unwanted color casts (e.g., excess yellow).
  - Adjust shadows and gain to remove blue or magenta contamination.

### Curves for Color Profile Differences

- Hue vs Hue:

  - Correct hue shifts caused by different camera profiles.

- Hue vs Saturation:

  - Subtle saturation balancing for specific colors.

- Benefit:

  - Precise color alignment without affecting the entire image.

### Continuous Visual Comparison

- Tools used:

  - Split screen.
  - Full-screen comparison.
  - Image wipes (vertical and horizontal).
  - Stills for reference.

- Workflow:

  - Constantly compare specific areas (sky, trees, objects).
  - Adjust → compare → refine.

### Final Balancing Across All Shots

- Global checks:

  - Brightness consistency.
  - Residual color casts (magenta, blue, yellow).

- Fine-tuning:

  - Minor sky tweaks.
  - Subtle saturation and hue shifts.

- Reality check:

  - Aim for perceptual match, not mathematical perfection.

### Key Takeaways

- Match shots in layers:

  - Luminance → white balance → focused color areas.

- Avoid global corrections:

  - Break images into sky, foliage, objects, shadows, and highlights.

- Result:

  - Faster, more accurate matching.
  - Cohesive scenes that feel shot at the same time with the same camera.

- Professional mindset:

  - If differences aren’t noticeable during normal playback, the match is successful.

## Key Takeaways and Skill Reinforcement for Shot Matching

### Skill Confidence and Progress

- Outcome:

  - Stronger confidence in matching shots consistently.
  - Improved ability to handle difficult footage.

- Importance:

  - Shot matching is a core skill for both professional colorists and self-color-correcting filmmakers.

### Core Concepts Reinforced

- Proper footage approach:

  - Apply structured workflows for easier matching.

- Image breakdown:

  - Avoid global adjustments.
  - Analyze and correct specific color areas:

    - Blues in skies.
    - Greens in trees.
    - Other distinct elements within the frame.

- Consistency mindset:

  - Focus on making shots feel cohesive across a scene.

### Essential DaVinci Resolve Tools

- Use of powerful built-in tools:

  - Scopes.
  - Secondary corrections.
  - Qualifiers and windows.
  - Curves for targeted color control.

- Purpose:

  - Enable focused, precise adjustments instead of broad corrections.

### Practical Perspective

- Example footage:

  - Extreme cases used for teaching clarity.
  - Real-world footage is usually less problematic.

- Realistic expectations:

  - Perfect matches are rare.
  - Perceptually consistent shots are the goal.

### Long-Term Application

- Following shooting guidelines:

  - Leads to cleaner, more flexible footage.

- Applying learned techniques:

  - Produces visually pleasing results.
  - Improves efficiency and confidence in future projects.

- Forward-looking mindset:

  - Skills learned here form a foundation for more advanced color work in future classes.
