title: "Plan & See: Foundations for Matching"
description: Start strong by planning for success. This module shows how smart shooting choices—exposure, white balance, and lighting—set you up for easier color work later. You’ll learn what to watch for on set and why those decisions matter once you open Resolve.
---

## Learning Objectives

- Identify on-set choices that simplify color matching in post.
- Outline a basic pre-shoot checklist for consistent exposure and color.
- Describe how camera settings and lighting impact later grading steps.

## ToC

- Intro
- Shooting for Easy Matching

## Matching Inconsistent Footage for Consistent Color Grading

### Course Overview

- Target audience: Advanced students with solid cinematography and DaVinci Resolve knowledge.
- Instructor background:
  - Professional colorist with over 10 years of experience.
  - Worked on 50+ feature films.
  - Clients include major brands such as Gucci, Prada, and ESPN.

### Core Problem Addressed

- Shot mismatch: Footage that looks impossible to match due to inconsistent shooting conditions.
- Common causes:
  - Poor exposure choices.
  - Inconsistent lighting.
  - Incorrect camera settings.

### Professional Colorist Approach

- Viewing footage analytically rather than emotionally.
- Breaking shots down into fundamental components:
  - Exposure
  - Color balance
  - Contrast

- Using scopes as the primary reference instead of relying only on the image.

### Techniques and Tools Emphasized

- DaVinci Resolve proficiency requirements:
  - Keys and HSL keys.
  - Curves.
  - Scopes interpretation.

- Applying structured workflows to normalize poorly shot footage before styling.

### Learning Outcome

- Turning severely mismatched shots into a cohesive visual look.
- Gaining repeatable techniques for future projects.
- Building long-term habits and mental models used by professional colorists.

### Course Scope

- Duration: Approximately 45 minutes.
- Focus:
  - Practical techniques.
  - Real-world problem solving with difficult footage.

- Goal:
  - Achieve consistent results across projects despite imperfect source material.

## Why Footage Doesn’t Match and How to Prevent It

### Common Causes of Mismatched Footage

- Camera settings differences:
  - White balance inconsistencies.
  - Different color profiles (one of the most common causes).
  - Exposure variations.

- Gear inconsistencies:
  - Different cameras.
  - Different lenses.
  - Filters and lighting equipment that vary between shots.

- Uncontrollable factors:
  - Time of day.
  - Location changes.
  - Natural light conditions.
  - Human error.

### Preventive Shooting Practices

- Lighting control:
  - Light your scenes whenever possible.
  - Avoid relying on natural light unless it is controlled with modifiers or lights.

- Camera setup:
  - Shoot in log format to preserve flexibility in post-production.
  - Never use auto modes.

- Lens and gear consistency:
  - Use a lens kit with similar lenses from the same manufacturer.
  - Avoid mixing lenses with different inherent looks.

### Simplified Best Practices Checklist

- Same camera.
- Same lenses.
- Same camera settings.
- Controlled lighting whenever possible.

### Post-Production Impact

- Matching internal camera settings across different cameras and locations significantly simplifies color correction.
- Consistency during shooting:
  - Reduces the risk of reshoots.
  - Saves time and money in post-production.
  - Prevents ruined or unusable shots.

### Next Step in the Workflow

- Learning how to analyze a shot to determine what adjustments are needed to match it with the rest of the scene.
